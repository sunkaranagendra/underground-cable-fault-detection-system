# underground-cable-fault-detection-system
Underground cables are prone to a wide variety of faults due to underground conditions, wear and tear, rodents etc. Also detecting fault source is difficult and entire line is to be dug in order to check entire line and fix faults. So here we propose an cable fault detection over IOT that detects the exact fault position over iot that makes repairing work very easy. The repairmen know exactly which part has fault and only that area is to be dug to detect the fault source. This saves a lot of time, money and efforts and also allows to service underground cables faster. We use IOT technology that allows the authorities to monitor and check faults over internet. The system detects fault with the help of potential divider network laid across the cable. 
Whenever a fault gets created at a point shorting two lines together, a specific voltage gets generated as per the resistors network combination. This voltage is sensed by the microcontroller and is updated to the user. The information conveyed to the user is the distance to which that voltage corresponds to. The microcontroller retrieves the fault line data and displays over LCD display, also it transfers this data over internet to display online.
